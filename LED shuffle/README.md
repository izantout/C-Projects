This project is one of the early C projects. In this project, we connected resistors to LEDs and connected the breadboard to an MCU (MicroControlling Unit) which we 
uploaded C code to to make the LEDs light upone by one in a pattern that is moving from left to right. If we press the button on the MCU, the pattern goes from left
to right faster (approximatley 0.5 seconds to switch from one LED to the other) , if the button is not pressed the pattern moves from left to right slower (approximatley 
1 second1 to switch from one LED to the other).
