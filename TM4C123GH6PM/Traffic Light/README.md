This project is a simple traffic light coded using the TM4C123GH6PM. When no buttons are pressed, we have a car 
at both sides thereofre the light keeps alternating to let both cars pass. If one button is pressed, there are no cars at that 
intersection so it lets the other car pass and stays in that state. If both buttons are pressed, there are no cars on both sides, therfore it keeps its last state.
