// There are many choices to make when using the ADC, and many
// different combinations of settings will all do basically the
// same thing.  For simplicity, this function makes some choices
// for you.  When calling this function, be sure that it does
// not conflict with any other software that may be running on
// the microcontroller.  Particularly, ADC0 sample sequencer 2
// is used here because it takes up to four samples, and three
// samples are needed.  Sample sequencer 2 generates a raw
// interrupt when the third conversion is complete, but it is
// not promoted to a controller interrupt.  Software triggers
// the ADC0 conversion and waits for the conversion to finish.
// If somewhat precise periodic measurements are required, the
// software trigger can occur in a periodic interrupt.  This
// approach has the advantage of being simple.  However, it does
// not guarantee real-time.
//
// A better approach would be to use a hardware timer to trigger
// the ADC conversion independently from software and generate
// an interrupt when the conversion is finished.  Then, the
// software can transfer the conversion result to memory and
// process it after all measurements are complete.
