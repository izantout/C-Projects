C code that is a representation of the Drag Race Christmas Tree. The program is coded to check 3 button inputs. 2 of them are where cars are supposed to be, and the third one is a reset button that goes back to red for both racers. When 2 cars are there pressing the sensors, the drag race begins and the lights go from red to yellow to another yellow and then to green. This code also takes into consideration false starts, and if that happens, a green light is displayed on the side of the winner. Lastly, this code checks which one left its place first (sensor is not pressed anymore) and displays a green light to show the winner. In addition to the code, I built an electriv cirvuit that looks like the Drag Race Christmas Light shown below.
